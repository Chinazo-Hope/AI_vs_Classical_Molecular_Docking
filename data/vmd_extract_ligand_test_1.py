"""
Script to extract and visualize a single ligand from a protein-ligand complex using VMD.

Overview:
This script automates the extraction of a ligand (identified by its residue name) from 
a protein-ligand complex PDB file using VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics). It also 
generates a PNG image snapshot of the extracted ligand structure for visualization 
and verification.

Functionality:
1. Loads the specified PDB file from the protein-ligand complex.
2. Selects atoms corresponding to the ligand residue using a VMD atom selection query.
3. Writes a new PDB file containing only the ligand atoms.
4. Generates a high-quality PNG snapshot of the ligand using VMDâ€™s rendering engine.

Inputs:
- A protein-ligand PDB file (.pdb) stored in data/pdb_files/
- The residue name (resname) of the ligand of interest
- A unique identifier to label output files and directories

Outputs:
- A PDB file of the extracted ligand: data/ligands/<unique_id>/<unique_id>.pdb
- A rendered PNG image of the ligand: data/ligands/<unique_id>/<unique_id>.png

Requirements:
- VMD must be installed and callable via the command line (e.g., 'vmd').
- The input PDB file must contain the specified ligand with a correct residue name.
- Paths and environment should reflect your local project directory structure.
